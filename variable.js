// Summary
// We can declare variables to store data by using the var, let, or const keywords.

// let – is a modern variable declaration.
// var – is an old-school variable declaration. Normally we don’t use it at all, but we’ll cover subtle differences from let in the chapter The old "var", just in case you need them.
// const – is like let, but the value of the variable can’t be changed.
// Variables should be named in a way that allows us to easily understand what’s inside them.
